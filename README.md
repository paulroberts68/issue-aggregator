# issue-aggregator
The issue aggregator has been designed to further encourage the creation of a collaborative development community within government. The objective is to be able to connect a number of development teams (who are using different software tools) and provide transparency into some of the issues that they might be facing (i.e. blocked stories). The community can then respond and help to identify or provide solutions.  

## Features
The issue aggregator provides a point of integration and aggregation of information for teams that sign up and join the API. The aggregator will facilitate the reporting of information from a number of tools including JIRA, GitHub, KanBoard as well as Trello. The aggregator comprises of an API hub that takes advantage of web-hooks provided by other third party applications and provides a dashboard view of the information in via Kanboard (an open source application).
